THIS IS NOT A VALID ROOM FILE
------------------------------------------
This file shows the generic format for writing a universe of rooms in csv

The general idea is that each room is comprised of 5 lines.
The first line contains, in this order, room ID number, classifier, room title, room description.
The following 4 lines are the 4 directional exits. Each exit direction contains the room ID number of the room the exit leads to
followed by a message to display when entering that room.

The room ID number 0 should be reserved for an impassible route. This is not hardcoded that way, but is the most logical way to do it.
In actuality, you can use any room ID number for a room that doesn't exist.

It's also worth noting that the room descriptions and exit messages can contain commas, but any other field can not.

Additional rooms in the universe are separated by 1 empty newline.
The file should end at the end of the last room, with no additional newlines.
Good form would be to use incrementing room numbers.

room id#, room classifier(inside/outside/whatever), room title, room description(room description can contain commas, but not classifier or title)
id# of room to exit NORTH to, message to display when exiting in that direction(message can contain commas
id# of room to exit EAST to, message to display when exiting in that direction
id# of room to exit WEST to, message to display when exiting in that direction
id# of room to exit SOUTH to, message to display when exiting in that direction

room id#, room classifier(inside/outside/whatever), room title, room description(room description can contain commas, but not classifier or title)
id# of room to exit NORTH to, message to display when exiting in that direction(message can contain commas
id# of room to exit EAST to, message to display when exiting in that direction
id# of room to exit WEST to, message to display when exiting in that direction
id# of room to exit SOUTH to, message to display when exiting in that direction

room id#, room classifier(inside/outside/whatever), room title, room description(room description can contain commas, but not classifier or title)
