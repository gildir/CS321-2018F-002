I can confirm that my team and I have been actively learning how to use git with the help of the resources below.
In addition to these resources, we have also been learning git during our weekly working meetings that we hold at Fenwick Library at 1:30 PM on Fridays.

Think like a git --- think-like-a-git.net x3
git - the simple guide --- rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ x4  
github learning resources - from github site
Git Immersion --- gitimmersion.com x2
